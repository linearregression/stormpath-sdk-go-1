## Meta

- Maintainer: [Randall Degges](randall@stormpath.com)
- Status: **IN DEVELOPMENT!**


## Purpose

This library provides [Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/) bindings for Go.  It's
very, *very* new, and currently in development.  The API for this library is
currently unstable, so you should only use it for testing.  As the library
matures, we'll update this README to include more specific information on usage
and what to expect.

The goal of this library is to provide a full wrapper around the Stormpath API
service, making it easy to manage Stormpath resources.
